> # **Project Heroic Age or Heroic Population**

### More information on the Carnegie Hero Fund Commission can be found here:
https://www.carnegiehero.org/

The Carnegie Hero Fund was established in 1905 by Andrew Carnegie who said "we live in a Heroic Age". This project will examine if people are more willing to risk their life for a stranger if they live in a smaller population area. I chose the Carnegie Hero Fund for data because of its requirements and number of years available. The award is given 4 times a year to civilians who voluntarily risks life to an "extraordinary degree" and have "no full measure of responsibility for the safety of the victim". Part One will focuse on cleaning and analysis of the Carnegie Hero Fund data. Part Two will introduce and clean population data from the Census Bureau. Part Three will merge the two data frames. Part Four will summarize my finidings.

### Relevant Packages:
Jupyter Notebook (my project is an .ipynb file) <br>
Python 3 and higher <br>
See requirement.txt for all packages<br>
I created my project on a Windows machine using Visual Studio Code and PowerShell creating a virtual environment in my Jupyter Notebook (kernel .venv Python 3.10.1)

### To Run:
For information on how to install and run Jupyter Notebook, please see the documentation at https://jupyter.org/install

- Install Jupyter Notebook with: pip install notebook in order to run the notebook, hero.ipynb
- Run the command jupyter notebook in the command prompt (Windows) or terminal (Mac).
- Navigate to the project directory CHM and open the hero.ipynb file

- Once the notebook has opened, select Kernel and Restart & Run All to run all cells in the file.

- Note: You might need to repeat the steps in this section to git clone and install requirements

- git clone https://github.com/happyhorseshoe/Heroic_Age

- Install required packages by running pip install -r requirement.txt
<br>

### Alternative Instructions for running:

- Setup: Run git clone <your repo url.git> to clone the repository.
-  the directory for the project ('CHM'), run python3 -m venv venv to create the virtual environment.
- Activate the newly created python virtual environment. From the project directory run the following command:
>> - if using Windows Command Prompt: venv\Scripts\activate.bat
>> - if using Linux or Mac with bash/zsh: venv/bin/activate
- For additional help troubleshooting, see the "venv - Creation of virtual environments" documentaiton: https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html
- Run pip install -r requirement.txt to install the required packages.
- From the project directory, run python src\hero.ipynb on Windows, or python src/hero.ipynb on Linux/Mac, then follow the terminal prompts.
